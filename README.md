# The Freshness
“The Freshness” is a meal kit delivery service that partners with local farmers and co-ops in your area to deliver meal kits comprised of only the freshest, local ingredients directly to your door.  It is a fictional business for which I created a fully functioning e-commerce site.  The material included in this paper demonstrates elements of an academic project I did for my WEB-250 course last semester. The front-end was implemented with markup languages such as HTML5 and CSS3 as well Javascript and Bootstrap CDNs. The backend was written with PHP and utilizes a MySQL database.
